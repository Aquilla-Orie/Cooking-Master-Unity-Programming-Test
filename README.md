# Cooking-Master-Unity-Programming-Test
Technical Assessment for Tentworks Interactive


## Update 1
Created a blank 2D project in Unity and set up two sprites (one red, one blue) as the two players

## Update 2
The game camera pans in and out by changing its orthographic size based off the distance between the players.
This was done by simply calculating the distance between the two players and adjusting the orthographic size
between two clamped values based off the distance.
